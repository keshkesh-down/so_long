## This project is a very small 2D game. It is built to make you work with textures, sprites. And some very basic gameplay elements.

### How to play
The game is able to play any map you want as long as it follow some specific rules:

The map has to be a `.ber` file.
It can only contain some of the following characters:
Character | Object
---|---
1	| Wall.
0	| Empty space.
C	| Collectable.
E	| Exit.
P	| Player starting position.
Q | Enemy.

- The map must be a rectangle surrounded by walls ‘1’.
- It must have at least one exit ‘E’. And only one player ‘P’.

*See some examples in the `maps` folder of this project.*
 
Use `WASD` or `← → ↑ ↓` to move. You move one tile at a time.
 
In future: 
- [ ] Add lvl-generator.
- [ ] Add menu (settings, level selection).
- [ ] Add music.
